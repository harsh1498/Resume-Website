At first I took advantage of it, but as years went by, I saw the difficulty of buying such gadgets. My parents bought it in hopes that it would give me access to knowledge that others at the time just could not access. I want to create it in order to make sure that others in the future never lack the opporunities I grew up with. I want to develop for everyone to experince the opporunities technology presented me.",
